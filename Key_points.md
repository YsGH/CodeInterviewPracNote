##Notes:

always always prepare questions to ask the interviewers, showing you are interested in the project, I personally always ask how and why the interviewer join the company

What are your projects! Try to not repeat the resume, one sentence to discribe is fine, must have a sellpoint, or ready to answer why we choose you!
*For me, good research, good problem solving ability. build the compiler hands-on, read lot of code, good at writing clean code, very fast learner, blablabla~~~*

behavior questions: try to give examples, do not let the interviewer feels you are hidding

knows what is the question for, don't kill yourself by going two much details. Try to solve problem youself, mention the possible problems and the assumption you made, interviewr will correct you. 
*e.g. for this question, we just consider the integer will not overflow, like that.*
