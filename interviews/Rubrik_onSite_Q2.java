Q2a
// Given a list of points in a plane, coordinates (x, y)
// there is a circle, centered at (0,0) with a radius r
// return the k closest points outside the circle

heap

Q2b
// Given an string only consisted of + and -
// e.g. -+---++--
// two players will change the string on each turn, each time, player can only change two adjacent - into +
// e.g. -+---++--  can be changed into -+++-++--, -+-++++-- or ,-+---++++
// the one cannot make a valid move lose the game
// assume both players try their best, given a start string return who will win

follow up
// how to optimization, reduce the time complexicity, cut branches

this follow up is a very good
