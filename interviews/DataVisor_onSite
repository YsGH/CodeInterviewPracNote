1, 青蛙过河:
有一条河, e.g. y=y0; y=y1; 和圆形的荷叶，(x, y, r);
求青蛙能不能沿着荷叶过河，和通过荷叶数最少的路径，bfs

2, Leetcode 99.
Follow up, so now you have a increasing int array you get from the inorder traverse of the tree
how to find these two elements?

// The interviewer keeps providing me some hints for me to get the code below. 
int[] findMistake(int[] array) {
    int[] res=new int[2];
    for (int i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i]>array[i+1]) {
            res[0]=i;
        }
        if (array[i+1]>array[i]) {
            res[1]=i+1;
        }
    }
    return res;
}

3, There is a box, with n balls with k different colors, each color c have ni balls, i from 1 to k
n1+n2+...+nk=n;

Get a function draw(), to draw a random ball from the box. return its color
with putback
1, optimaze draw time o(1), space need o(n)
2, have space o(k), draw()? I made a solution time o(k), then, o(logk), binary search
without putback
3, HashMap, time o(k), how to get o(logk), did not find the answer.
I mentioned I need a tree like data structure to update the info, like trie tree, Segment tree is the answer. The interview told me that
