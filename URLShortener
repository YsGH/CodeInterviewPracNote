看描述好像是url里的id如果有某些位置大小写换了会导致原来的url decode有问题，需要重写encode方法，回溯改某些位的大小写判断

Often, we want to encode raw IDs in our database by hiding them behind some 2-way decodeable hash. 
So, a URL which would have at one time been: 
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/848662 
becomes https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/kljJJ324hjkS_ 
We decode the ID kljJJ324hjkS to 848662 on our backend and serve the relevant content. 
At some point, we start getting 404 errors from clients requesting a certain URL of the form 
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/kljjj324hjks 
This can happen if certain clients, email services, or url shorteners "sanitize" the url. 
Unfortunately, this change breaks decoding and the resource cannot be found. 
To assess how big of a deal this is, we may want to recover the IDs of the targets that were 404ing. 
Given a method decode(testEncStr) which will return the decoded int id if testEncStr is decodeable 
or will throw an exception (or return null) if not, implement a new method decodeFind(String badEncStr) 
which takes a string and returns the decoded int id. 


数据库中 sting 和 int 有一一对应关系，可以encode decode， 并且是case sensitive。 e.g. kljJJ324hjkS decode to 848662
但是如果string 中大小写被改变，就没有办法decode。
现在给出decode程序，要求实现decodeFind，能够将大小写被改过，没办法decode的string，找到原本正确的decoded int

解法：用recursive method，把string的每个字母大小写两种情况，试最后得到的每个string是否能decode
