There are 10 wizards, 0-9, you are given a list that each entry is a list of wizards known by wizard. 
Define the cost between wizards and wizard as square of different of i and j. To find the min cost between 0 and 9.
10个wizards，给list of list，是每一个wizards认识的wizards，wizards i j 认识的cost是 (i－j)^2, 求wizards 0 9 认识的最小cost
说白了，就是带权重的最短距离，最优解是Dijkstra algorithm。似乎面试官说，只要普通的BFS能得到解也是可以的，Dijkstra我最近正好写过，所以也写出来了。
